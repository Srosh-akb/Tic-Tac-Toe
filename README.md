## Background
Using the Minimax Algorithm, the AI model learns to play tic-tac-toe in the most optimal way, creating an unbeatable player.

The Minimax Algorithm works by considering the best possible options from either players perspective. 
Therefore, assuming both players play optimally, the AI model can choose the move that has the highest likelihood of yielding success.
